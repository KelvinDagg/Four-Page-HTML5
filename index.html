            <h2>The Goal</h2>
            <p>The main point of this website is to prove that I can make a website that
            is 4 web pages big, make sure it has a number of elements in it to prove I can write
            a semantically correct web page. You will see off to the side that there is a lot of
            Batman Ipsum (Lorem Ipsum, but with batman quotes, as if you didn't already know it!)
            I am only writing this extremely simple site so that I can knock out the assessment
            and get it all ticked off for my Certificate Four.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>The Styling</h2>
            <p>I have added in Sass into the document because I need to really work on it in my diploma.
            I have submitted enough CSS stylesheets in my time for you to know that I can write proper
            CSS. The SASS file will perfectly compile my styling and help me to improve how quickly I
            can get this whole project finished.</p>

                I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.
                Does it come in black?
                Ah yes! I was wondering what would weight first. Your spirit... or your body?
                I'm here to ensure the League of Shadow fulfills its duty to restore balance to civilization. You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years with all your strength, all your resources, all your moral authority. And the only victory you achieved was a lie. Now, you understand? Gotham is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.
                You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.
                I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.
                You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling.
                I am the League of Shadows.
                It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.
                Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.
                I speak for the rest of the board and Mr Wayne, in expressing our own excitement.
                What if, before she died, she wrote a letter saying she chose Harvey Dent over you? And what if, to spare you pain, I burnt that letter?
                Dr. Crane isn't here right now. But if you'd like to make an appointment.
                I know why you choose to have your little, ahem... group-therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know why you're afraid to go out at night. The Batman.
                You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline.
                You hung up your cape and your cowl but you didn't move on. You never went to find a life.
