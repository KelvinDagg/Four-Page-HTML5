            <h3>The Goal</h3>
            <p>The main point of this website is to prove that I can make a website that
            is four pages big, make sure it has a number of elements in it to prove I can write
            a semantically correct web page and also just in general practice. You will see off to the side that there is a lot of
            Batman Ipsum (Lorem Ipsum, but with batman quotes, as if you didn't already know it!)
            I am only writing this extremely simple site so that I can knock out the assessment
            and get it all ticked off for my Certificate Four.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>The Styling</h3>
            <p>I have added in Sass into the document because I need to really work on it in my diploma.
            I have submitted enough CSS stylesheets in my time for you to know that I can write proper
            CSS. The SASS file will perfectly compile my styling and help me to improve how quickly I
            can get this whole project finished.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3>The Markup</h3>
            <p>Utilising HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript, this page will come to life before
            your eyes. There will not be much Javascript incorporated into the website, but
            there will be enough to show an understanding of the language. Html5 is used entirely
            through this project. You will also find advanced SASS involved in the overall styling.</p>
            <br/>
            <div class="img-container"><img class="html-logo" src="img/html-css-js.png" alt="Html, Css and Javascript logo's."/><p>1.1 The logo's for HTML 5, CSS 3 and Javascript</p></div>
            <br/>
            <h3>The Font</h3>
            <p>The fonts used on the site come from google fonts. The links are in the head section.
                They link to the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">google fonts</a> website. There,
                you can use any font that is displayed on the website for free, as long as they are an
                open source font. The two that I have used here are:
            </p>
            <br>
            <blockquote>
                <h3>Headings: The Ovo Font</h3>
                <hr/>
                <p>Paragraphs: The Muli Font</p>
            </blockquote>
            <br/>
            <p>These fonts are both open source and work well with the page.</p>

            <h3>This is the Batman Ipsum</h3>
            <p>
                I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men like this but I will not become an executioner.
                Does it come in black? <br/>
                Ah yes! I was wondering what would weight first. Your spirit... or your body?<br/>
                I'm here to ensure the League of Shadow fulfills its duty to restore balance to civilization.
                You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years with all your strength, all your resources,
                all your moral authority. And the only victory you achieved was a lie. Now, you understand? Gotham
                is beyond saving and must be allowed to die.<br/>
                You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.<br/>
                I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.<br/>
                You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry
                too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey.
                One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna
                see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars. So, I do this to myself.
                And you know what? She can't stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling.<br/>
                I am the League of Shadows.<br/>
                It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.<br/>
                Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.<br/>
                I speak for the rest of the board and Mr Wayne, in expressing our own excitement.<br/>
                What if, before she died, she wrote a letter saying she chose Harvey Dent over you? And what if, to spare you pain, I burnt that letter?<br/>
                Dr. Crane isn't here right now. But if you'd like to make an appointment.<br/>
                I know why you choose to have your little, ahem... group-therapy sessions in broad daylight. I know
                why you're afraid to go out at night. The Batman.<br/>
                You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline.<br/>
                You hung up your cape and your cowl but you didn't move on. You never went to find a life.<br/>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum? (Or Batman Ipsum for that matter)</h3>
            <br/>
            <p>Batman Ipsum is a form of Lorem Ipsum, which basically helps developers to fill out a page and see
            what it would look like with a bit of content. It helps with making sure the layout is right, the font
            is the right size, style and generally looks good. You can generate a whole number of different Ipsum's
                such as:</p>
            <br/>
                <ul class="midList">
                    <li><a href="https://lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum - The original</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.batman-ipsum.com/">Batman Ipsum - The Dark Knight Trilogy Ipsum</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://baconipsum.com/">Bacon Ipsum - A porky alternative</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://slipsum.com/">Samuel L Jackson Ipsum - A Motherf****ng good ipsum</a></li>
                </ul>
            <br/>
            <p>
            All of these are great examples of lorem ipsum that you can incorporate into your mock-ups, style tiles,
            prototypes and anything else to get the right look and feel of your website. It is an ever so handy tool
            for all front-end developers.
