        <h3 id="intro">1. Introduction - Why do we want our website to be "Findable"?</h3>
        <hr class="style-two">
            <p>Well let me ask you this - Would you start a business and not advertise?<br>
                Because essentially that is what you are doing when you make your website findable, you make advertise it
                to the world, to google, to people who will search "Tony's Pizza Parlour" or "Alex - Freelance Web Designer"
                without the techniques that will be on display below, your website won't rank on google. If those last 4 words
                made you scratch your head, then you might want to consider reading the following. It will hopefully give you an
                understanding into the world of SEO (Search Engine Optimisation), website findability and beyond.</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> It will take you through a research project of mine which was on the Google Search Engine API, which essentially puts
                    a google search engine into your website for free, that allows users to search through your website for certain content.
                    More on that <a href="#google">Here</a>.</p>

    <h3>2. SEO Best Practices</h3>
        <hr class="style-two">
        <h4>A summary of the techniques I learnt in findability</h4>
        <br>
        <ul class="bestPrac">
            <li class="dark"><strong>Title Tag - </strong>
                Ensure your title reflects the main purpose of the website e.g. Woofs - Dog grooming service. Length, 10 to 70 characters.</li>

            <li><strong>Meta Description Tag - </strong>
                This states what the purpose of the website is in more detail e.g.
                Dog grooming service that offers a mobile option that comes to you and pampers your favourite pooch
                while making their coat silky smooth to the touch. Length 70 to 320 characters.</li>

            <li class="dark"><strong>Header Tags - </strong>
                Header tags tell search engines what topics are important. These also
                prioritise the keyword search algorithms that search engines use.</li>

            <li><strong>Keyword Consistency - </strong>
                Search engines cross reference keywords to the headings. Keywords should appear consistently in the titles, description
                and the headers for best results.</li>

            <li class="dark"><strong>Backlinks - </strong>
                Having other sites reference back to your website give search engines a strong indication as to your sites authority,
                relevance and ranking position.</li>

            <li><strong>Robots.txt - </strong>
                The Robots.txt file lets search engines know what is appropriate for them to crawl through.</li>

            <li class="dark"><strong>Sitemap.XML - </strong>
                The sitemap file instructs the search engines how the website is laid out, letting them know the logical order of
                the content.</li>

            <li><strong>Usability - </strong>
                A strong multi device and user interaction experience will increase your search engine ranking.</li>

            <li class="dark"><strong>Performance - </strong>
                Having a responsive, fast loading web site will ensure the user experience will be more enjoyable.</li>

            <li><strong>Social Media - </strong>
                Having an active social media presence will instruct search engines that your site is more reputable due
                to the interconnections.</li>

            <li class="dark"><strong>Security - </strong>
                Having an SSL certificate lets search engines know that communications and transactions are more secure.</li>
